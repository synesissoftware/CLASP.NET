## Introduction

**CLASP** stands for Command-Line Argument Sorting and
Parsing. The first CLASP library was a C library with a C++ wrapper. There
have been several implementations in other languages. **CLASP.NET** is the
.NET version.

All CLASP libraries provide the facilities to **C**ommand **L**ine
**I**nterface (**CLI**) programs as described in detail below.
